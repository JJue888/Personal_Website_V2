            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>Hi, welcome to my website. I'm Joshua Jue, a passionate and driven computer science major with a deep love for all things technology. Allow me to introduce myself and share a glimpse into my journey, interests, and aspirations in the world of computing.
              </p>

            <h2>My Journey</h2>
              <p>My journey began during high school when I programmed my first web application. Being able to constantly find solutions to problems motivated me to continue on the path of becoming a computer science major. Since then, I've come a long way from that basic web application with the many projects I've worked on and the different concepts I have learned.
              </p>
